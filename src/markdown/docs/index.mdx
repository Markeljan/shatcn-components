Shatcn components are a collection of poop and fart-inspired styled React Tailwind components. 
Most of the components are based on <a target="_blank" href="https://ui.shadcn.com/">Shadcn UI</a>.

Shatcn is a meme-inspired design system that embraces poop-shaped elements, brown color palettes,
and plumbing-themed green accents. Shatcn refuses the usual components of UX-UI design
and embraces organic, irregular shapes with distinctive brown color schemes and toilet-themed styling.

I created this collection of components for people who want to learn more
about the shatcn meme style and to help them get started with creating poop-inspired
layouts with plumbing accents.
